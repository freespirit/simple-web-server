# About

Nothing special, just the multithreaded web server from the book - 
[Final Project: Building a Multithreaded Web Server](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html)

# Why?

It's an exercise. As stated in the book this implementation is not production ready but shows different concepts and 
gives an overview how some "real-world" web servers work.
